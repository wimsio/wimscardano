The **Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution** outlines the principles and framework for governing the decentralized Cardano ecosystem, which includes blockchain technology, smart contracts, and community governance. Established in 2017 by three founding entities—Input-Output Hong Kong (IOHK), Emurgo, and the Cardano Foundation—the Cardano Blockchain expanded in 2020 to include independent validators and introduced on-chain governance in 2024.

The Constitution aims to create a decentralized, inclusive governance system for all participants, empowering them to collectively manage the blockchain's future. It recognizes the importance of balancing decentralization with accountability, ensuring transparent decision-making, and safeguarding the security of the network.

Key points:
- **Governance**: The governance system is designed to involve all Ada holders, with decentralized representatives (DReps) voicing the will of the community in on-chain voting.
- **Community Collaboration**: The Constitution emphasizes collaboration among diverse actors in the Cardano ecosystem, including developers, enterprises, and stakeholders.
- **Guardrails**: The inclusion of **Cardano Guardrails** ensures the safe management of treasury funds.
- **Evolving Framework**: As the ecosystem grows, the governance model will evolve, guided by the community’s shared values and blockchain technology.

This Constitution is more than just a governance document for a blockchain; it sets the foundation for the entire Cardano ecosystem, fostering innovation, transparency, and community-driven decision-making. It empowers participants to contribute to the growth and success of the Cardano Blockchain.

**Article I: Cardano Blockchain Tenets and Guardrails** outlines core principles that guide the Cardano Blockchain Community and ecosystem. These Tenets provide the foundation for evaluating governance actions and ensuring the effective and fair operation of the Cardano Blockchain.

### **Section 1: Tenets**
- **Transaction Freedom**: Transactions on the Cardano Blockchain should be timely and not subject to censorship or unnecessary delays.
- **Predictable Costs**: Transaction costs on the blockchain should be transparent and reasonable.
- **Development Freedom**: Developers should not face unreasonable barriers to creating and deploying applications on the Cardano Blockchain.
- **Fair Contribution Recognition**: Community contributions should be recognized and rewarded fairly, with rewards shared with Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) and Delegated Representatives (DReps) through fair tokenomics and consensus approaches.
- **Owner Autonomy**: Ada owners should have control over their assets, with no forced restrictions or lock-ins.
- **Interoperability**: The blockchain should support seamless interaction with partner chains and external systems.
- **Data Preservation**: Ada owners’ data and assets should be securely stored on the blockchain.
- **Efficient Resource Use**: The Cardano Blockchain should avoid wasting resources, ensuring sustainability.
- **Equality**: All users of the blockchain should be treated equally, with decisions made in the best interest of the long-term viability of the ecosystem.
- **Financial Stability**: The total supply of Ada should be capped at 45 billion Ada (45,000,000,000,000,000 Lovelace), maintaining financial stability.

### **Section 2: Cardano Blockchain Guardrails**
- The Cardano Blockchain must adhere to the **Guardrails** outlined in the Guardrails Appendix. These rules may be digitally encoded and implemented directly on the blockchain through on-chain scripts or ledger rules.
- In case of discrepancies between the Guardrails in the Appendix and those implemented on the blockchain, the on-chain version will take precedence. The Constitutional Committee will work to resolve any inconsistencies through on-chain governance actions.

The Tenets and Guardrails ensure a stable, fair, and interoperable environment for all participants in the Cardano ecosystem, supporting its growth and long-term sustainability.

### **Article II: The Cardano Blockchain Community**

#### **Section 1: Participation in the Cardano Blockchain**
- No formal membership is required to use or participate in the Cardano Blockchain. 
- All owners of Ada, developers, those building on the blockchain, and anyone supporting or using it are considered part of the Cardano Community.
- All participants are beneficiaries of the Cardano ecosystem and this Constitution, entitled to its rights, privileges, and protections, and are expected to support and uphold the Constitution.

#### **Section 2: On-Chain Decision-Making Rights**
- Ada owners are entitled to participate in on-chain decision-making, including voting and engaging in on-chain governance related to the Cardano Blockchain.

#### **Section 3: Responsibility of the Cardano Community**
- Members of the Cardano Community are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem by following the Constitution, participating in governance activities, and resolving disputes fairly and transparently.

#### **Section 4: Collaboration and Formation of Organizations**
- The Cardano Community is encouraged to collaborate in the development and maintenance of applications for the blockchain and to form temporary or permanent organizations, associations, or entities in support of the ecosystem.

---

### **Article III: Participatory and Decentralized Governance**

#### **Section 1: Governance Model**
- The Cardano Blockchain will operate under a decentralized, on-chain governance model using smart contracts and other blockchain-based tools to ensure transparency and decision-making. 
- On-chain governance actions will follow the processes outlined in the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails.

#### **Section 2: Governance Bodies**
- Three independent governance bodies will participate in voting for on-chain governance actions: Delegated Representatives (DRep), Stake Pool Operators (SPOs), and the Constitutional Committee (CC).

#### **Section 3: Collective Decision-Making Process**
- On-chain governance decisions will be made through a collective process with consensus thresholds, as required by the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails.

#### **Section 4: Ada Owners' Rights to Vote**
- All Ada owners have the right to vote on governance actions, subject to any restrictions in the Constitution and the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails. 
- Ada owners can also propose changes to the governance structure. If Ada is held by third-party custodians, the owner can authorize or withhold authorization for the custodian to vote on their behalf.

#### **Section 5: Community Sentiment without On-Chain Change**
- A special form of governance action, "Info" actions, will allow the community to gauge sentiment without committing to an on-chain change. These actions will have no effect other than to record the vote outcome.

#### **Section 6: Transparency in Governance Proposals**
- All proposed governance actions must follow a standardized format with sufficient rationale to justify changes to the blockchain.
- Proposals for significant changes (e.g., "Hard Fork Initiation" or "Protocol Parameter Change") must undergo technical review to ensure they do not compromise the blockchain's security, functionality, or sustainability.
- The process for submitting, voting on, and participating in on-chain governance actions must be transparent and protected from undue influence.

#### **Section 7: Off-Chain Governance**
- The Cardano Community must support the creation and administration of off-chain governance processes to ensure awareness and participation in shaping future governance actions.

#### **Section 8: Cardano Blockchain Budget**
- The Cardano Community must propose an annual budget for the blockchain’s maintenance and future development.
- Ada owners must approve the budget through an on-chain governance action. No withdrawals from the treasury will be allowed unless they are part of an approved budget.
- Budgets must include oversight measures, including independent audits and metrics on how the funds are used.
- Any governance request for funds must allocate resources for audits and include dispute resolution provisions.

--- 

This framework ensures that Cardano remains a transparent, decentralized, and participatory ecosystem, where all members, particularly Ada owners, are integral to the governance and ongoing development of the blockchain.

Here's a simplified and structured breakdown of the provided content, focusing on key points:

This breakdown simplifies the governance framework, highlighting key roles, responsibilities, and processes for DReps, SPOs, and the Constitutional Committee. It also outlines the amendment process for adapting the Constitution over time.

### APPENDIX I: CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN GUARDRAILS

#### 1. INTRODUCTION
To implement on-chain governance for the Cardano Blockchain in alignment with CIP-1694, it is essential to establish guardrails that ensure the network operates securely and sustainably. This Appendix outlines the guardrails for governance actions, such as protocol parameter changes and treasury withdrawals, to maintain the stability and performance of the blockchain.

These guardrails cover essential limits based on technical insights, real-world experience, and governance objectives. Some guardrails are automatable, enforced by on-chain scripts or ledger rules. The principles here apply to the Cardano Blockchain Layer 1 mainnet and not test environments or other blockchains using Cardano software.

The document is a living resource, subject to amendments as new data, simulations, or evaluations become available. If new parameters are introduced, additional guardrails may be required.

#### Amending, Adding, or Deprecating Guardrails
The guardrails in this Appendix can be amended through on-chain governance actions that meet the voting threshold. Amendments will be treated as changes to the Constitution, with each guardrail receiving a unique label. If a guardrail is deprecated, its label will no longer be used in future amendments.

#### Terminology and Guidance

- **Should/Should not:** Recommendations that could be adjusted by expert groups.
- **Must/Must not:** Requirements enforced by the ledger, with violations potentially leading to protocol failures or security issues.
- **Benchmarking:** System-level performance evaluations to ensure performance under specific conditions, like block diffusion time.
- **Performance Analysis:** Projecting performance based on tests or theoretical models.
- **Simulation:** Synthetic execution to detect potential issues before deploying code.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Measuring actual network behavior to inform decisions.
- **Reverting Changes:** Reverting changes if they don't meet performance requirements.
- **Severity Levels:** Issues are classified based on their impact:
    - **Severity 1:** Critical issues with high impact.
    - **Severity 2:** Major issues with significant impact.
    - **Severity 3:** Minor issues with low impact.

#### Automated Checking ("Guardrails Script")
The **Guardrails Script** is tied to the Constitution hash and ensures compliance with governance actions, specifically **Parameter Update** and **Treasury Withdrawal** actions. This script helps prevent situations where erroneous actions can lock the blockchain into an irreversible state.

---

#### 2. GUARDRAILS AND GUIDELINES ON PROTOCOL PARAMETER UPDATE ACTIONS

The following guidelines apply to protocol parameter updates, ensuring that the Cardano Blockchain never enters an unrecoverable state. This section also outlines the correct procedure for updating parameters.

**Guardrails for Protocol Parameter Updates:**

- **PARAM-01 (y):** Protocol parameters not explicitly listed in this document **must not** be changed by a governance action.
- **PARAM-02 (y):** If a parameter is listed but lacks checkable guardrails, no constraints will be imposed by the guardrails script.

**2.1 Critical Protocol Parameters**
These parameters are crucial for the security and operation of the blockchain:
- *Maximum block body size* (`maxBlockBodySize`)
- *Maximum transaction size* (`maxTxSize`)
- *Maximum block header size* (`maxBlockHeaderSize`)
- *Maximum size of serialized asset value* (`maxValueSize`)
- *Maximum script execution/memory units in a single block* (`maxBlockExecutionUnits`)
- *Minimum fee coefficients* (`txFeePerByte`, `txFeeFixed`)
- *Minimum fee per byte for reference scripts* (`minFeeRefScriptCoinsPerByte`)
- *Minimum Lovelace deposit per byte of serialized UTxO* (`utxoCostPerByte`)
- *Governance action deposit* (`govDeposit`)

**Guardrails for Critical Parameters:**
- **PARAM-03 (y):** Critical parameters require an SPO vote in addition to a DRep vote. SPOs must collectively support the proposal with more than 50% of active block production stake.
- **PARAM-04 (x):** Normally, at least 3 months should pass between the proposal and the governance action for critical parameters. This can be expedited in the event of a Severity 1 or 2 network issue after careful evaluation.

**2.2 Critical Governance Parameters**
These parameters are essential to governance:
- *Delegation key Lovelace deposit* (`stakeAddressDeposit`)
- *Pool registration Lovelace deposit* (`stakePoolDeposit`)
- *Minimum fixed rewards cut for pools* (`minPoolCost`)
- *DRep deposit amount* (`dRepDeposit`)
- *Constitutional Committee size and term length limits*

**Guardrails for Governance Parameters:**
- **PARAM-05 (y):** DReps must vote "yes" with more than 50% of active voting stake.
- **PARAM-06 (x):** As with critical protocol parameters, a 3-month interval should pass between proposal publication and the on-chain governance action. However, this can be shortened in the event of network issues.

#### 3. ECONOMIC PARAMETERS

The aim for economic parameters is to ensure long-term sustainability for the Cardano ecosystem and to balance incentives across stakeholders like stake pool operators, ada holders, and developers. The following triggers and counter-indicators guide changes to economic parameters:

**Triggers for Change:**
1. Significant changes in the fiat value of ada, impacting security, performance, or sustainability.
2. Changes in transaction volumes or types.
3. Requests or suggestions from the community.
4. Emergency situations requiring immediate adjustments.

**Counter-indicators:**
Changes should not be made in isolation but must account for external economic factors, network security, and the health of the network's stakeholders.

**Core Metrics for Monitoring:**
- Fiat value fluctuations of ada.
- Transaction volumes and types.
- Stake pool numbers and their health.

This section aims to ensure that Cardano’s economic model remains resilient, flexible, and aligned with the network's long-term goals.

### 2.3 Network Parameters

The goals when managing the Cardano Blockchain network parameters are to:

1. **Match the available Cardano Blockchain Layer 1 network capacity** to current or future traffic demands, including payment transactions, Layer 1 DApps, sidechain management, and governance needs.
2. **Balance traffic demands** for different user groups, including payment transactions, minters of Fungible/Non-Fungible Tokens, Plutus scripts, DeFi developers, Stake Pool Operators, and voting transactions.

#### Triggers for Change
Changes to network parameters may be triggered by:

1. **Measured changes in traffic demands** over a 2-epoch period (approximately 10 days).
2. **Anticipated changes in traffic demands** based on forecasts.
3. **Community requests** for adjustments or improvements.

#### Counter-indicators
Changes may need to be reversed or avoided in the event of:

- Excessive **block propagation delays**.
- **Stake pools** being unable to handle traffic volume.
- **Scripts** being unable to complete execution due to resource limitations.

#### Core Metrics
All decisions on parameter changes should be informed by the following core metrics:

- **Block propagation delay profile**.
- **Traffic volume** (block size over time).
- **Script volume** (size of scripts and execution units).
- **Script execution cost benchmarks**.
- **Block propagation delay/diffusion benchmarks**.

Detailed benchmarking results are required to confirm the effect of any changes on mainnet performance or behavior before enactment. The effects of different transaction mixes (normal transactions, Plutus scripts, and governance actions) should be analyzed.

### Guardrails
- **NETWORK-01**: No individual network parameter **should** change more than once per two epochs (10 days).
