### WIMS Cardano Blockchain Whitepaper  
**Version 1.0**  
**October 2024**

---

#### **Abstract**

Women In Move Solutions (WIMS) Cardano is a blockchain-driven initiative founded in 2018, aimed at empowering women in technology and fostering innovation within underrepresented communities across Southern Central Africa. Utilizing the Cardano blockchain, WIMS provides decentralized solutions in education, finance, and entrepreneurship. Our vision is to create a transparent, inclusive, and sustainable ecosystem where women, youth, and marginalized communities can thrive through blockchain technology.

This whitepaper details the WIMS-Cardano token ($WIMT), its utility, governance, and the ecosystem it supports.

### WIMS Ecosystem

WIMS is a collection of blockchain business ventures catering to various communities, with activities including developing exchanges, training, distributed services, smart contracts, bitcoin mining, trading, hackathons, blockchain securities, forks, and content provision. These solutions will address women's financial, economic, and educational needs worldwide, adhering to the principles of gender equality, skills transfer to women, and fostering positivity, motivation, patience, and training.

### Membership Benefits

Investors, stakeholders, and members will benefit from holding WIM or WIMT tokens, granting access to WIMS exchanges, voting rights, mining rights, profits, employment screening, vendor services, discounts, and more. WIM tokens will be mined by WIMS and delegated vendors who meet WIMS principles.

### Blockchain

**Figure 5:** [Wikipedia on Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8f3a61e-dbce-4881-aa6a-cf072f8c1a1b)

Common blockchain issues include network inefficiencies, slow transactions, irreversible stolen bitcoins, unverified accounts, security reliance on users, legal ambiguities, ease of forking, anti-centralization, volatility, lack of scalability, data duplication, and miner control. Future blockchains (Blockchain 3.0) aim to address these issues by focusing on scalability, interoperability, sustainability, and governance.

### WIM Coin

The WIM Coin will be created from the WIM blockchain, designed by women competing to create a secure, efficient, scalable, and fast blockchain. The coin will be used for daily transactions, eliminating common blockchain weaknesses and combining the best practices of centralized and decentralized systems.

### WIMT

WIMT (WIM Token) will be used for fundraising on the Cardano network. One WIMT will be valued at $0.01. The hard cap is set at 80 billion WIMT ($800 million), funding 11 WIM projects globally. Unsold WIMT tokens will be burnt to increase demand due to scarcity.

### Sales

Pre-sale WIMT tokens will be priced at $0.00035, offering a 50% discount. Public sale tokens will be priced at $0.0007. Distribution will be transparent, avoiding hidden agendas, with a focus on community building and engagement.

### Traditional Projects

WIMS funds will finance property development, mining, farming, and industries, offering low-interest loans to women-focused initiatives. Investments will also extend to emerging industries like IoT, AI, and robotics.

### WIMS Team

The project is led by a dedicated team with a focus on performance and growth through hard work. Contact details for various team roles are provided, including technical, management, and advisory positions.

### Legal Standing and Compliance

WIMS is established in South Africa. The South African Reserve Bank classifies bitcoins as intangible assets without regulatory oversight. WIMS will maintain legal and compliance standards through ongoing updates and a dedicated legal division.

### KYC/AML

Each WIMS member must comply with their local laws, with WIMS exchanges following international FICA requirements.

### Security Policies

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17a979ee-a717-48a4-95e9-1422da6dbfff)

WIMS ventures will adhere to stringent security policies to ensure safe operations.

### SWOT

**Strengths:**
