## Note

Please read the following notice carefully before proceeding to read this Whitepaper issued by Women In Move Solutions (Pty) Ltd, a company incorporated and existing under the laws of South Africa (hereinafter referred to as the "Distributor"). This notice applies to all persons who read this document. Please note that this notice may be altered or updated.

The Whitepaper does not constitute any relations between you (hereinafter referred to as "you" or "Holder") and the Distributor. Women In Move Solutions will be referred to as WIMS. Acquiring WIMT / WIM tokens/coins or participating in WIMS business activities constitutes acceptance of WIMS Terms and Conditions (hereinafter referred to as "T&C"). The T&C are published at [https://www.wims.io/termsandconditions.txt](https://www.wims.io/termsandconditions.txt).

## Regulatory Compliance

Different countries have different regulations and requirements for their citizens regarding crypto and blockchain industry activities such as Bitcoin, trading, exchanges, Smart Contracts, DAO, Distributed Applications (dApps), and similar activities.

## WIMS Objectives

WIMS is a collection of various traditional business activities, blockchain, and crypto ventures aimed at empowering and protecting women worldwide. As such, individuals from various countries can participate in these activities, as not all are prohibited in all countries. This is supported by the fact that UN Women are embracing blockchain technology.

### Why Not Focus on a Single Project?

We aim to:

- Eliminate investment risk created by volatile crypto assets
- Offer various choices to women
- Create a self-reliant and self-sustaining ecosystem

One of WIMS’s objectives is to assist UN Women in their search for blockchain solutions that will help women. 

### Complaints and Inquiries

Any complaints, criticism, inquiries, or questions relating to legal or compliance matters must be sent in writing to [legal@wims.io](mailto:legal@wims.io).

## Division Operations

This document does not provide details on how each venture of WIMS will operate. Each division will publish their own sub-white papers and mini-business plans, detailing their operations, budgets, and auditing deliverables. Remember, the Bitcoin White Paper was not more than 15 pages, and it is not necessary to convert a white paper into a fully detailed business plan.

## Executive Summary

In the last nine years, from 2009 until 2018, we have seen the rise of blockchain businesses worldwide, with a significant gender gap. According to Kelsey Cole (2018), "Only 4-6% of Blockchain and cryptocurrency participants are female."

The problem of the lack of substantial participation of women in the blockchain industry is so acute that a simple search for females vs males in blockchain on the internet brings up many shocking articles.

### Active Leadership

You might note that the active legal director of the incorporated WIMS is a male, Bernard Sibanda. He is merely a facilitator, caretaker, and coordinator whose role is to release all shares to the rightful powerful women bred by the activities of WIMS. The goal is to have 196 active women visionary directors, each representing one of the 196 countries of the world. If this fails, then the entire WIMS initiative is a farce.

## Supporting Articles

The five articles below support the above statement:

1. [Where Are The Women In The Blockchain Network?](#)
2. [Women In Blockchain And Crypto: How To Tackle Gender Inequality](#)
3. [Crypto Is Booming. But Where Are The Women?](#)
4. [We Need More Women in Blockchain & Cryptocurrency](#)
5. [Cryptocurrencies for Change: Why We Need Women on the Blockchain](#)

Despite the high participation of women in social media, there is a significant gap in the blockchain sector. Given that 70% of the world’s poor are women and the top 10 cryptocurrency billionaires are men, there is a pressing need to address this gender gap in the blockchain industry. Empowering women financially through blockchain businesses, combined with traditional ventures, is a viable solution to eliminate world poverty.

### WIMS Mission and Vision

WIMS is a collection of blockchain business ventures aimed at achieving gender balance in the blockchain and other businesses. The WIMT token facilitates the coordinated technical skills transfer among men and women. Our objectives include:

- Encouraging women to create blockchains, mine cryptocurrencies, create and run cryptocurrency exchanges, trading engines, and hard fork coins.
- Supporting women in competing to create security systems and blockchain innovation R&D activities.
- Developing blockchain solutions that reduce or eliminate the abuse of women.

### Introduction

#### About WIMS

WIMS refers to a global blockchain-based community engaged in different businesses with one aim: the empowerment of women. There are many organizations named Women In Move (WIM), which are not related to Women In Move Solutions (WIMS). For us, WIM is the coin to be created under the guidelines stated below. To avoid being linked and listed as a scam movement, WIMS is a registered entity.

It is not a women-only movement but one where all participants do business and make a profit, with women as key members and men as co-members. Empowering women means empowering all families because women are our mothers, wives, sisters, grandmothers, and daughters.

#### Why WIMS?

WIMS aims to achieve the following:

1. **Business:** Access to WIMS services and products (loans, training, trading, reviews, exchanges, apps, online services).
2. **Economic:** Secure investment (1 token backed by multiple projects).
3. **Gender:** Promote women empowerment worldwide.
4. **Social:** Promote global unity and respect for women.
5. **Technological:** Produce effective and efficient solutions.
6. **Psychological:** Promote self-esteem, reliance, and fulfillment.
7. **Spiritual:** Promote the religious beliefs of participants.
8. **Political:** Promote women's political governance.
9. **Physical:** Support the wellness of human beings.

### Vision

We dream of a day when millions of women all over the world mine transactions, create blocks, and get rewarded in cryptocurrency. We envision women providing blockchain-efficient services that are easy to use, adopt, secure, and scalable like social media. WIMS aims to kick-start a revolution that will achieve these dreams without gender bias.

Our mission is to emancipate women and the poor from the chains of poverty and physical abuse through cutting-edge blockchain solutions in an acceptable way.

WIMS addresses several key issues:

1. Blockchain gender gap.
2. Worldwide poverty.
3. Blockchain educational problems.
4. Geographic and cultural barriers hindering women's progress.
5. Social, psychological, religious, and cultural obstacles that enslave women and drive them out of the blockchain industry.
6. Spread further blockchain good news.
7. User experience.
8. Physical abuse of women worldwide.

### Solution Strategies

1. Work with women to create easy, less expensive, efficient, and secure blockchain services and businesses.
2. Encourage women to lead financially viable blockchain businesses: women-run ICOs, exchanges, mining, trading, and smart contract creation.
3. Train women through involvement, coaching, and positive attitudes.
4. Produce blockchain products that break or free women from geographic and cultural barriers.
5. Engage women in creating censorship-free distributed apps.
6. Create awareness about blockchain benefits, such as fast global transactions, immutable systems, secure and affordable services.
7. Implement best practices from centralized and decentralized worlds.
8. Influence gender change in many large organizations globally.
9. Use the WIM Token (WIMT) for fundraising and stakeholder voting. Develop a popular and efficient WIM blockchain and WIM coin, a digital currency for shoppers.

Women will be incorporated into groups to compete in creating blockchains, distributed applications, smart contracts, exchanges, wallets, mining, training, and solutions to eliminate abuse.

## O. Road Map 2019

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f5b2639-a066-4ddb-b4ea-ecddd7cde0b0)

### Market Size

**Figure 2:** [2030 Projection of Blockchain Technology Market](https://next.autonomous.com/insights/2030-projection-of-blockchain-technology-market)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf8f1383-efff-4b46-a497-ada8ef8b8c22)

The blockchain market size is set to exceed USD 16 billion by 2024, according to a new research report by Global Market Insights, Inc. Assuming WIMS captures just 0.001% of this market, that will amount to $16 million.

According to recent research by Hubary Yuan from Huobi Pro Company, there are 20 million blockchain users out of 4 billion internet users globally, within a world population of 6 billion. This demographic is illustrated in Figure 3: the yellow circle represents blockchain users, the green circle represents internet users, and the blue circle represents the global population.

Regarding the gender gap, Hubary Yuan's study showed that 17% of the bitcoin community is female, depicted in Figure 4, where the green slice of the circle represents the female portion.

These statistics suggest that WIMS is not only viable but also has the potential to address the gender gap and bring more users to blockchain technology.

### Target Market

WIMS’ target market includes all women in the world (approximately 3.8 billion) and men, as the principle is to innovate with women as active implementers of blockchain technology. One objective of WIMS is to assist UN Women in their search for blockchain solutions to help women, addressing a significant problem recognized by the UN.

### Marketing Strategy

WIMS will utilize a decentralized marketing strategy where each division has coordinators responsible for marketing their specific area. The strategies include:
- Competitions, bounties, airdrops, and token distributions to selected communities.
- Campaigns by members to promote WIMS projects in women's organizations.
- Payments to marketers and promoters in WIM Tokens, which can later be redeemed for WIM Coins.
- Discounts for men who support WIMS.
- Sponsorship of fashion shows, women's beauty products, education, and business with WIM Coins, branding them as bonds of love among families and as shoppers' petty cash.

### WIMS Ecosystem

WIMS is a collection of blockchain business ventures catering to various communities, with activities including developing exchanges, training, distributed services, smart contracts, bitcoin mining, trading, hackathons, blockchain securities, forks, and content provision. These solutions will address women's financial, economic, and educational needs worldwide, adhering to the principles of gender equality, skills transfer to women, and fostering positivity, motivation, patience, and training.

### Membership Benefits

Investors, stakeholders, and members will benefit from holding WIM or WIMT tokens, granting access to WIMS exchanges, voting rights, mining rights, profits, employment screening, vendor services, discounts, and more. WIM tokens will be mined by WIMS and delegated vendors who meet WIMS principles.

### Blockchain

**Figure 5:** [Wikipedia on Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8f3a61e-dbce-4881-aa6a-cf072f8c1a1b)

Common blockchain issues include network inefficiencies, slow transactions, irreversible stolen bitcoins, unverified accounts, security reliance on users, legal ambiguities, ease of forking, anti-centralization, volatility, lack of scalability, data duplication, and miner control. Future blockchains (Blockchain 3.0) aim to address these issues by focusing on scalability, interoperability, sustainability, and governance.

### WIM Coin

The WIM Coin will be created from the WIM blockchain, designed by women competing to create a secure, efficient, scalable, and fast blockchain. The coin will be used for daily transactions, eliminating common blockchain weaknesses and combining the best practices of centralized and decentralized systems.

### WIMT

WIMT (WIM Token) will be used for fundraising on the Cardano network. One WIMT will be valued at $0.01. The hard cap is set at 80 billion WIMT ($800 million), funding 11 WIM projects globally. Unsold WIMT tokens will be burnt to increase demand due to scarcity.

### Sales

Pre-sale WIMT tokens will be priced at $0.00035, offering a 50% discount. Public sale tokens will be priced at $0.0007. Distribution will be transparent, avoiding hidden agendas, with a focus on community building and engagement.

### Traditional Projects

WIMS funds will finance property development, mining, farming, and industries, offering low-interest loans to women-focused initiatives. Investments will also extend to emerging industries like IoT, AI, and robotics.

### WIMS Team

The project is led by a dedicated team with a focus on performance and growth through hard work. Contact details for various team roles are provided, including technical, management, and advisory positions.

### Legal Standing and Compliance

WIMS is established in South Africa. The South African Reserve Bank classifies bitcoins as intangible assets without regulatory oversight. WIMS will maintain legal and compliance standards through ongoing updates and a dedicated legal division.

### KYC/AML

Each WIMS member must comply with their local laws, with WIMS exchanges following international FICA requirements.

### Security Policies

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17a979ee-a717-48a4-95e9-1422da6dbfff)

WIMS ventures will adhere to stringent security policies to ensure safe operations.

### SWOT

**Strengths:**
- Diverse blockchain and traditional business activities empower women globally.
- Strong volunteer base and online community.
- Diversified risk through blockchain and traditional industries.

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited financial resources and infrastructure.
- Technical and security challenges for older members.

**Opportunities:**
- Unique focus on solving women's empowerment through blockchain.

**Threats:**
